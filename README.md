# Voter Fraud Detector

A short program to detect everyone past the age of 100 that has voted.

The input format is CSV, which can be acquired at https://data.pa.gov/widgets/mcba-yywm (this is an official goverment database and as such there is no question whether it is accurate) by pressing Menu > Download > CSV.
